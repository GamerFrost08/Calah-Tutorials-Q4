		<h1 align= center> Our First Promotional Plan </h1>
			<center><p> The First Promotional Plan we used was a Poster, the poster we used had all the information needed, we also posted this on our own social media platforms to be able to spread it quite efficiently, but it wasnt eye-catching enough to us to gain a following.</p>

		<h1 align= center> Our New Promotional Plan </h1>
			<center><p> Our new Promotional Materials included videos and pictures as a way to keep the audience on track, updated, and excited for our new stream. The Content of our video is similar to our poster from last quarter, but this is more eye-catching due to it being a video.</p>

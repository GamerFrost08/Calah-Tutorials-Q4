	<h1 align= center> What are Stream Outlines?</h1>
		<p>A stream outline is an organized way of coming up with the stream's agenda as well as putting it in order for a smooth flow. It's like the agenda in a presentation or the table of contents in a book. Without a stream outline, the stream becomes disorganized and chaotic. </p>

<div class="demo5">
	<h1 align= center> Our Stream Outline </h1>
		<p> As you can see from the table below, our stream will be lasting for 2 hours. We'll be having an introduction, 3 discussions, 1 intermission, 1 open discussion, and a conclusion. The first discussion about "Signs that you as a student is getting impacted by video games negatively" will be lasting 30 minutes. The introduction, and the 2 other discussons will be lasting 20 minutes each. The Question and Answer, Intermission, and Conclusion will be lasting for 10 minutes each. We tried to think of the most efficient outline that we could have in order to keep our viewers hooked but not overwhelm them too much. </p>

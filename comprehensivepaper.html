		<h1 align= center> Summary of Stream </h1>
			<p> In the stream outline, the first part of the stream was the introduction of the topics which is “Gaming’s effects on academics” it also included the introduction of the hosts of the stream, but due to the person who was hosting the first part being inexperienced the introduction was not able to reach the expected time stated in the stream outline which was 15 minutes. The hosts were forced to move on to the next part of the stream which is “Signs that you are getting impacted negatively by video games. The host for this one was able to present this topic very well but due to the first part not meeting the expected time length, the other hosts needed to join the presentation and add their own personal experiences to meet the expected time, thanks to that the first half of the stream ended well. The stream proceeded to have the intermission break, during this, the group experienced a technical problem due to the internet, and made the stream end. The problem was able to be fixed before the end of the intermission break. But the abrupt end of our stream led to some of our viewers thinking that our stream has already come to an end, which led to the second part of our stream having significantly less viewers than we had earlier. We didn't want to pay much attention to the number of viewers because that would kill our energy. Thanks to that mindset we had, we were able to make the second part of the stream more fun and engageable for the viewers we had left. The next part of the stream according to the stream outline is “Reason why you are getting negatively impacted by video games”. The host of this topic did a good job at discussing the topic and keeping the engagement level with the audience very high. The second to the last part of the stream is “Habits you can do to prevent those negative effects”. The host of this part was very creative at presenting their topic by creating a to-do list and giving advice on how to make a healthy to-do list. How does this end?</p>

		<h1 align= center> The Positive Outcomes of the Stream</h1>
			<p>In an overall summary the things that went well are as follows, First and foremost the stream that was planned had a lot of well rounded discussions. Secondly, the first part of the stream was really good at opening up the topic to be discussed during the stream and opened a lot of opportunities not only for the streamers, but also for the viewers to interact and learn. Thirdly, the next topic was ”Signs that you are getting impacted negatively by video games.” That was also a lot of well discussed topics and overall went well and for the most part informed the viewers After, the stream had a short intermission break. Fourth thing that went well as, the topic of  “Reasons on why you are getting impacted by video games.” was discussed  and overall was not able to only inform the audience but also entertain them with the experiences of the streamers. Fifthly, the last topic which was discussed during the live stream was “Habits you can do to prevent those negative influences.” was taught to the viewers and definitely gave them a new perspective into time management for students with their E-games, which provided them the necessary information to learn and certainly gave them a start into a new student life. In conclusion to this, there are five very positive outcomes that came from the stream, that may help a lot of students with their E-game addiction/problem, to not only find the root cause of it and also find a proper solution and a proper way to battle it.</p>

		<h1 align= center> Areas of Opportunities in our Stream</h1>
			<p>At the start of the first stream, the introduction was okay but it could have been much better. The flow was messy and uncoordinated with too many pauses. We consider this an area of opportunity because we could have done better if we had calmed down instead of letting our nerves get the better of us. After that it was okay, since our other streamer had joined us already, relieving us and helping us coordinate well. Another area of opportunity is during the break when we had a technical difficulty which ended our stream. This is something we should have had a back up plan to and it took too long for us to start again, giving a delay and misunderstanding to our viewers. We could have improved by noticing that quicker and booting up the second part of the stream. The other areas of opportunity were more of things to improve as our streamers were definitely nervous at parts and could not be focused on the task at hand.</p>

		<h1 align= center>Engagement Levels of the Stream </h1>
		<p> In our first stream, when we started to do our livestream, which was the first time, many comments were coming up, which is good because they also tried to support and interact with our stream. It was also entertaining and pleasurable, because we also tried to communicate and interact with them while we explained our topic which is about “Video games’’ to help them to study better with their video games, which can help for the students. In our short intermission break, many comments were coming up at that time. We also look through it while we’re getting ready for our next stream. In our next stream, we answered their topic-related questions, while we’re explaining our video games topic. Our experience was good and challenging, the questions were easy to understand and it was pleasurable though during our stream. We answered their deep topic-related questions, and the flow of our stream was good even though it was a bit difficult. We tried our best to answer their questions to support our stream and to be in touch with our viewers. While we were about to end our stream, we also answered some of their questions and communicated with our viewers. In conclusion to our engagement levels of our stream, our real-time interaction with our audience is authentic, high attention and high commitment. It interacts with our viewers as they tune in and give attention, by responding to our comments and answering questions in real time. Even though it was challenging, it was good and fun because we also discovered and experienced some enjoyment while we’re doing our stream.</p>

		<h1 align= center>Viewership Analysis of the Stream</h1>
		<p>According to the graph below at the start of the stream the viewership steadily increased throughout the numbers, as such the overall viewership peaked at 7 viewers and had an average of 4 viewers throughout the stream. For the second graph it showed at the start of the stream that the viewership increased drastically resulting in the viewership to reach high, but steadily dropped throughout the stream as it reached its climax and as a result the stream did less than before on the first graph, as such the viewership only peaked at 5 viewers and only averaged 2 viewers throughout the rest of the stream. There are quite a few reasons why the stream had low viewership, first is the reason is low promotion on the day of the stream, this can come into effect because probably people forgot that the stream was supposed to be on that day itself. Secondly is competition, when the stream started, there were also quite a handful of streamers that streamed at the same time resulting in less viewership overall.</p>
